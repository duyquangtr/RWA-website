    <!-- What We Learned -->
    <section class="section">
      <h1 class="section-title">What We Learned</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Our analysis highlights how macro liquidity, yield environments, and multichain deployment jointly shape the
        evolution of the RWA sector.
      </p>

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <h2>Stablecoin Supply Predicts RWA Growth</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          RWA expansion is tightly linked to stablecoin liquidity. Total stablecoin market capitalization correlates
          strongly with RWA TVL (R² = 0.87), indicating that stablecoins function as a reliable proxy for deployable
          capital within DeFi. Periods of rapid stablecoin issuance consistently precede surges in RWA adoption.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> Rising stablecoin supply is a leading indicator—typically 4–8 weeks ahead—of
          renewed investor inflows into tokenized real-world assets.
        </p>

        <h2>Interest Rates Drive Asset Preference Rotations</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Shifts in the U.S. Treasury yield environment reshape how investors allocate capital across RWA categories.
          When yields were below 4%, private credit platforms dominated. As yields climbed past 4% in 2023–2024,
          capital rotated sharply toward safer, tokenized Treasury products. New entrants offering on-chain Treasury
          exposure captured substantial market share during this high-rate period.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> RWA flows reflect traditional finance behavior—investors reposition toward the
          best risk-adjusted yield available.
        </p>

        <h2>Market Concentration Is High, but Declining</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          While the top three RWA protocols still account for roughly 70% of total TVL, concentration is falling over
          time. The rise of tokenized Treasuries, multichain deployments, and new product categories has broadened the
          competitive landscape. The downward trend in the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) confirms a shift toward a
          more distributed, multi-protocol ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> Although RWA remains top-heavy, competition is increasing—improving rates,
          product diversity, and overall market resiliency.

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <h2>For Protocol Developers</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Launching products during periods of rising stablecoin supply maximizes capital inflow potential. Protocols 
          should adjust product mixes according to rate regimes—emphasizing Treasury products in high-yield environments 
          and Private Credit offerings when yields decline. Building initially on Ethereum provides access to deep 
          liquidity, while multichain expansion unlocks additional demand.
        </p>

        <h2>For Investors</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Stablecoin issuance serves as a forward-looking indicator of RWA growth. Investors can position portfolios to 
          rotate between asset types—Treasury, Private Credit, and Diversified RWAs—as macro conditions shift. 
          Diversification across protocols also mitigates concentration risk.
        </p>

        <h2>For Policymakers</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Stablecoin regulation will directly influence the capacity of RWA markets. Federal Reserve rate decisions 
          filter instantly into on-chain asset demand. Additionally, multichain deployment raises regulatory complexity 
          because tokenized assets may simultaneously fall under multiple jurisdictions.

    <!-- Future Research -->
    <section class="section">
      <h1 class="section-title">Future Research Directions</h1>

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <p class="subtitle">
          While our findings establish core relationships between macro liquidity and RWA capital allocation, further 
          research can deepen understanding of investor behavior and market structure.
        </p>

        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Apply statistical and machine-learning tools—such as classification models, logistic regression, and vector 
          autoregression (VAR)—to identify predictive signals and potential causal pathways in RWA dynamics.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Analyze on-chain wallet behavior to understand investor segmentation, capital flow timing, and responses to 
          macroeconomic events. Integrate sentiment indicators (developer activity, social platforms, governance 
          participation) to explore how narratives influence adoption.
        </p>

        <h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Compare risk-adjusted returns across RWA asset types to distinguish true performance from simple TVL growth.
          Evaluate how regulatory changes—such as MiCA in Europe or proposed U.S. stablecoin frameworks—impact the pace 
          and composition of RWA adoption.
