    <!-- What We Learned -->
    <section class="section">
      <h1 class="section-title">What We Learned</h1>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Our analysis highlights how macro liquidity, yield environments, and multichain deployment jointly shape the
        evolution of the RWA sector.
      </p>

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <h2>Stablecoin Supply Predicts RWA Growth</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Total stablecoin market cap strongly correlates with RWA protocol adoption at R^2 = 0.87, confirming that
          stablecoins serve as a reliable proxy for available DeFi liquidity. When stable supply grows, RWA protocols
          follow.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> If you see stablecoin supply rising, expect RWA investment to spike 4-8 weeks
          later. For crypto investors, this is your early warning signal to position capital as digital dollars increasingly
          back underlying assets like bonds and real estate.
        </p>

        <h2>Interest Rates Drive Asset Preference Rotations</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          When Treasury yields exceeded 4% in 2023-2024, capital shifted dramatically. Treasury-backed RWA protocols
          surged 15% to 45% market share, capturing $2.5B in new capital within six months.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> Crypto investors chase traditional yields. When the Fed raises rates, money flows
          from risky lending into safe tokenized Treasuries.
        </p>

        <h2>Market Concentration Is High, but Declining</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          The top 3 protocols control roughly 70% of total value locked, with Ethereum dominating 85-90% of capital.
          However, diversification is underway as Solana, Polygon, and Base capture growing shares.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          <strong>This means:</strong> The market is dominated by a few players, creating concentration risk which
          means competition is accelerating. This drives better rates and more options as platforms compete for capital.

    <!-- Practical Implications -->

      <h1 class="section-title">Practical Implications</h1>

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <h2>For Protocol Developers</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Launch new protocols during periods of rising stablecoin supply to accelerate capital assumption.
          Adjust your product offerings based on interest rates – emphasize Treasury-backed products when yields
          are high and Private Credit products when rates are low. Build on Ethereum first, then diversify to other
          chains for additional market share.
        </p>

        <h2>For Investors</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Use stablecoin supply as a leading indicator as it signals RWA growth 4-8 weeks in advance. Diversify your
          portfolio, so that when treasury yields shift, capital can rotate between asset types. This would also help 
          mitigate concentration risk, given the top three platforms control 70% of the market.
        </p>

        <h2>For Policymakers</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Stablecoin regulation will directly affect RWA market capacity, as our strong correlation demonstrates.
          Federal Reserve rate decisions can substantially influence how capital flows through DeFi. Multi-chain 
          deployment creates regulatory risk, as assets cross multiple regulations simultaneously.

    <!-- Future Research -->

      <h1 class="section-title">Future Research Directions</h1>

      <p class="subtitle">
        Our research establishes fundamental correlations between macro liquidity and RWA capital allocation. However,
        there may also be third-party variables which require further analysis:
      </p>

      <div class="narrative-block">

        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Apply advanced statistical methods such as classification trees, logistic regression, and VAR models to reveal
          causal relationships beyond correlation.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavioral Analysis</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Examine on-chain transaction data to assess individual investor decision patterns and response to macro
          events. Track on-chain capital flows using bridge protocol data to map how assets move from blockchain 
          to blockchain. Incorporate sentiment analysis from social media and developer activity to assess market behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Study how evolving and differing regulations such as MiCA in Europe and proposed U.S. stablecoin laws affect
          RWA adoption rates and market composition. Compare risk-adjust returns across different RWA asset types to assess 
          true preference beyond raw TVL growth, which may be inflated.
