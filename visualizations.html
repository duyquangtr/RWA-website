      <p class="section-subtitle">
        The following dashboard walks through our four-part analytical framework for understanding how
        macroeconomic liquidity, yield environments, and multichain deployment shape the evolution of the Real-World
        Asset (RWA) sector. Each section pairs narrative explanation with visual evidence to show how capital enters
        the system, rotates between asset types, spreads across blockchains, and ultimately accumulates across RWA
        protocols.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          The Macro Liquidity vs RWA TVL chart shows that as stablecoin supply and on-chain liquidity expanded, the
          entire RWA sector grew rapidly rather than concentrating in one or two dominant protocols. Early in the
          timeline, RWA adoption was small, so TVL was heavily concentrated in pioneers like Centrifuge and Maple.
          But once stablecoin liquidity surged in 2023–2025, significantly more capital flowed into the ecosystem,
          enabling a wider range of protocols to attract deposits. This broad-based liquidity expansion reduced overall
          concentration, which is reflected in the declining HHI values over time.

        <p class="subtitle">
          At 0.4% month-over-month growth, M2 is classified as Neutral, meaning liquidity conditions are stable but not
          significantly expansionary. This environment supports ongoing RWA activity but does not provide the strong
          liquidity tailwinds observed during high-growth periods.

      <h3 class="section-subheading">Stablecoin Supply vs RWA TVL</h3>
      <p class="subtitle">
        RWA sector growth is strongly linked to stablecoin liquidity. As total stablecoin market capitalization rises,
        RWA TVL scales alongside it—indicating that stablecoins function as a leading indicator for RWA expansion.

          RWA TVL rises alongside total stablecoin market capitalization, showing that stablecoins act as the main
          source of deployable on-chain capital. As liquidity expanded from 2023 to 2025, RWA adoption accelerated across
          multiple platforms. The trend highlights how sector growth depends on the availability of stablecoin liquidity.

          Strong positive correlations between RWA TVL and stablecoin supply confirm that liquidity conditions drive
          expansion in the RWA sector. Relationships with M2 and Treasury yields reveal how broader macro environments
          influence capital allocation. Liquidity growth and yield conditions together shape the pace and direction of
          RWA adoption.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          The Capital Allocation by Asset Type chart reveals major shifts in investor preference across Diversified,
          Private Credit, and Treasury-backed RWAs. When the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield was low, private credit
          dominated, concentrating TVL in credit-focused protocols like Maple and Goldfinch. However, as the 10-Year
          yield climbed in 2023–2025, capital rotated sharply into tokenized Treasuries, allowing newly launched
          Treasury-focused platforms (e.g., Ondo Finance, Superstate) to capture substantial market share. This
          yield-driven reallocation diversified the RWA landscape and directly reduced protocol concentration,
          contributing to the downward trend observed in the HHI index.

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Shifts in the 10 Year Treasury yield correspond to rotations in investor allocation. Low yields push capital
          toward higher return private credit platforms, while rising yields increase demand for safer tokenized
          Treasury products. Changing macro incentives reshape the balance of RWA asset types and diversify the 
          overall market.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          The Chain Allocation Over Time chart shows the RWA market expanding from primarily Ethereum-based protocols to
          multiple chains, including Solana, Avalanche, Mantle, Plume, and XRPL. As more chains became viable
          environments for tokenized assets, new RWA protocols emerged natively on these chains or migrated to them, 
          breaking the early dominance of a few Ethereum-only platforms. This multi-chain diversification lowered barriers 
          to entry and enabled more protocols to accumulate meaningful TVL. As a result, the protocol concentration decreased 
          steadily, which is captured clearly in the Altair HHI line chart.

          Early RWA growth was concentrated on Ethereum, but TVL gradually expanded to Solana, Avalanche, Mantle, and
          other chains. The movement toward a multichain footprint reduces dependence on a single network, enables
          faster scaling, and distributes settlement risk across different ecosystems.

      <h2 class="section-subheading">4. Protocol-Level Market Structure &amp; Concentration</h2>

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          The Yield Regimes vs Asset Composition visualization shows that RWA investors responded strongly to shifting
          Treasury yield environments. Rising yields created a boom in tokenized Treasury products, which directly
          enabled new specialized protocols to grow. While early RWA TVL was concentrated in private-credit-focused
          platforms, the yield-driven surge in Treasury demand redistributed TVL across a broader set of competitors.
          This yield-induced rotation reduced market concentration and produced the gradual HHI decline (section 4) seen
          in the Altair chart, especially during 2023-2025.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Given the steady decline in concentration shown in the HHI chart and the continued diversification highlighted
          across all four D3 visualizations, the near-term trend points toward an increasingly competitive and
          multi-protocol RWA ecosystem. With Treasury yields stabilizing and more institutions entering the tokenization
          space, new specialized platforms are likely to emerge, especially those focused on institutional-grade
          issuance, real-time settlement, and multi-chain interoperability. Simultaneously, established players will continue
          expanding to new chains and asset classes. As a result, protocol concentration is expected to remain relatively
          low, reflecting a maturing market where liquidity is distributed across a broader set of issuers, chains, and
          RWA product types.
