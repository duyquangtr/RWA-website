      <p class="section-subtitle">
        The following dashboard walks through our four-part analytical framework for understanding how 
        macroeconomic liquidity, yield environments, and multichain deployment shape the evolution of the Real-World 
        Asset (RWA) sector. Each section pairs narrative explanation with visual evidence to show how capital enters 
        the system, rotates between asset types, spreads across blockchains, and ultimately accumulates across RWA 
        protocols.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          RWA adoption begins with liquidity. Stablecoins serve as the primary settlement asset across DeFi, and their 
          total supply closely tracks the amount of “deployable capital” available for RWAs. When M2 money supply and 
          stablecoin liquidity expand, investors have more on-chain dollars to allocate—fueling broad-based increases 
          in RWA TVL. Early in the sector, TVL was small and concentrated in a few pioneer protocols. As liquidity 
          surged in 2023–2025, growth accelerated across multiple platforms, laying the foundation for a more 
          competitive ecosystem.

      <p class="subtitle">
        RWA sector growth is strongly linked to stablecoin liquidity. As total stablecoin market capitalization rises, 
        RWA TVL scales alongside it—indicating that stablecoins function as a leading indicator for RWA expansion.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          Interest rates determine the relative attractiveness of different RWA categories. When Treasury yields are 
          low, investors favor private credit protocols that offer higher returns, leading to TVL concentration in 
          credit-focused platforms. As Treasury yields rise, capital rotates into safer, tokenized Treasury products— 
          enabling new entrants like Ondo Finance and Superstate to capture significant market share. This rotation 
          diversifies the RWA landscape and reduces reliance on a small number of private-credit protocols.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          The RWA ecosystem originally launched on Ethereum, but as the sector matured, protocols expanded across 
          multiple chains—from Solana and Avalanche to Mantle and newer RWA-focused networks. Multichain deployment 
          lowers barriers to entry for new protocols, enables faster scaling, and reduces concentration risk by 
          distributing TVL across different settlement environments.

      <div class="narrative-block">
        <p class="subtitle">
          Combining the effects of liquidity expansion, asset-type rotation, and multichain deployment helps explain how 
          the protocol landscape evolved. Early RWA TVL was concentrated in a handful of private-credit protocols. As new 
          liquidity entered the system and more chains became viable deployment targets, protocol-level competition 
          increased and market share spread more evenly across platforms.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          While the top three protocols still hold a majority of TVL, the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) shows a clear 
          downward trend, indicating decreasing concentration and a healthier, more competitive ecosystem.
